I hope this will work out as I want it to. Welp, at least I get to see what it will look like to just write nonsense on my first blog entry.
It's actually not a bad idea to record my learning progress.
So: today I set up my Website Development Environment using the course on Coursera as base.
In this course I was instructed to set up an account on GitHub, but because the version used in the course was so different from the current GitHub version, I couldn't follow the instructions.
That's why I decided to learn with the GitHub documentation how to e.g. set up my first blog/github-pages and several other different first steps like editing a file in a resporitory etc.
